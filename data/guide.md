I.B. Do an interview with a Regional Coordinator to complete your pledge.

## Interview process

A Regional Coordinator is a volunteer dedicated to supporting Mozilla Club Captains. After you apply to be Club Captain, you will be interviewed by a Regional coordinator.

They will contact you using the email address you provided. Together you’ll set up a time for an interview. The goal of the interview is to learn more about your interests and how the Mozilla Club program can support you in realizing those goals. It’s also a chance to raise questions and to meet a Regional Coordinator.

## Completing your pledge

At the end of the interview, if the program is a good fit for your interests and local community, a Regional Coordinator will be assigned to your club and invite you to review and sign the Club Captain pledge at the end of this document.

Please return a signed copy of the pledge to the Regional Coordinator. Once that is received,  your club will be displayed on teach.mozilla.org and you will officially be a Mozilla Club Captain!

Don’t forget to register yourself on [Mozillians.org](https://mozillians.org/). You are now also apart of the Mozilla family.

I.C. Share Your Goals with peers

### Setting Goals

A Mozilla Club is an opportunity for you and your learners to be more empowered online and to be better facilitative leaders.

Take a moment to identify what your personal goals are: why do you want to host a Mozilla Club? What do you personally want to be able to do or achieve through your experience as a Club Captain?

Think about the types of learners you want to reach as well. What skills and experiences will be most relevant to them? What will they want to learn and make?

Consider even some conversations with potential learners to help identify what your club’s goals can be.  

**Sharing with Peers**

There are Mozilla Club Captains all over the world. Together, we are a community that learns with and for each other. We have additional advice and experiences we’re happy to share so that your club is more fulfilling, effective and fun.

When you’re ready with your personal and club goals, post them to [our Discussion Forum](http://discourse.webmaker.org/category/clubs).

Throughout your engagement with Mozilla Clubs, here’s how you can connect with peers:

* Twitter. Share ideas, questions and pictures to [@Mozteach](https://twitter.com/mozteach) and use the tag [#TeachTheWeb](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23teachtheweb&src=typd)

* Email. Send an email to [teachtheweb@mozillafoundation.org](mailto:teachtheweb@mozillafoundation.org) or email your Regional Coordinator directly.

* * *


## II. Prepare Your Team, Your Learners and Your Space
[Week 2 - 3]

II.A. Name your club and find a team.

### Name your club

Your club is yours to design. Once you have submitted your pledge and agreed to follow the guidelines outlined in part I of this document, it’s time to give your club a brand.

The Mozilla brand helps identify your club as part of our global network and mission.

* Follow [the guidelines set forth here](https://docs.google.com/a/mozilla.com/document/d/1uBQRcq_QKjn4EWkcmUd-zCC4Qfr4LMebj1Fg2hB-qoU/edit?usp=sharing) for naming and branding your club including what to name your club, create a domain, develop a logo, determine a mission and much more.

### Find a team

Running a club with other volunteers can be more fun and sustainable. We suggest having at least one fellow co-organizer. Consider peers, colleagues, family and others to get involved.

There is no magic number of mentors, but a rough ratio of 1:7 mentor to learner ratio ensures participants get personal attention.

Need help finding mentors? Try one of these tips:

* **Local schools**. Approach nearby colleges, universities or schools and see if any students want to mentor. You might contact teachers in a relevant field directly, or leave signs on message boards.

* **Co-workers.** Often times the people we work with are eager to assist and learn as well. Send out an email to your office asking if anyone is interested.

* **Local organizations.** There might be an organization nearby that is looking for ways for their employees to get more involved in the community.

* **Learners.** Ask those who are attending the club if they have a parent, relative or friend who is interested in mentoring. Or maybe they want to become mentors themselves!

* **Online**. Put a call out for mentors on your website, local forums and social media. You never know where the message will land.

II.B. Schedule your first three sessions and invite your learners.

What’s a club with no learners? Now that you have a stellar team ready to teach, start recruiting individuals to attend your club.

* **Create a sign-up page**. Your club can be either drop-in or registration, but make sure there is an effective way for individuals to indicate attendance and get access to regular event info. [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) or [Google Forms](http://www.google.com/forms/about/) are good spots to gather information and follow up with potential attendees. Having a rough idea of how many learners will attend will give you a better idea of how to prepare stations, materials and mentors.

* **Print Material**. Don’t underestimate the power of a good old fashioned poster that tells the details of your club. Make sure they stand out so they catch the attention of passers-by. You can post them at bus stops, schools, local coffee shops, libraries, community centers and anywhere else that makes sense in your location.

* **Community boards and mailing lists.** Find places where the local community is talking and sharing about upcoming opportunities. These can even take the form of community groups on Twitter and Facebook. Ask members to help share the club within their networks.

* **Word of Mouth**. Your friends and family are a powerful network. If they don’t know someone, they might know someone who knows someone. Spread the word far and wide at the next event, function, office or place you go to.

* **Blog.** Share your experience running a club on your blog, or even write a guest post on other relevant blogs. If you’re looking for somewhere to start, join the community [on Discourse](http://discourse.webmaker.org/category/clubs) where you can publish posts and connect to educators around the world.

II.C. Ensure a safe, welcoming environment.

A club should be a place that learners feel welcomed and inspired. Creating a safe environment is an important aspect of running and maintaining a Mozilla Club. Though expectations can vary from country to country there are measures you can take to help ensure safety at your events such as a safe recruitment of volunteers, creating a code of safety for volunteers, identifying outlets for safe and/or anonymous feedback, and many others.

* Clubs must meet in public places such as a coffee shop, schools, community centers or library community room.

* **Before the event.** When sharing information or promoting the event include all information on where the event will be held and who will be present. Share know who is running the event. If any minors should wish to attend your event, you should have their parents or legal guardians also attend or get their formal consent in their child’s participation. Any participant under the age of 13 must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. There may be specific data protections, especially for minorbackground information on yourself and other club volunteers so learners and their families s, in your region. Make sure you are aware of and comply with any such laws and regulations. You may not photograph, video or audiorecord attendees without their express permission, or, for minors, without express parental consent. (Please note that certain kinds of photographing, audiotaping, and videotaping of particular age groups may be prohibited by law in certain countries.)

* **During the event.** Upon arrival, inform learners about the space and anything they need to know that would make them feel more comfortable, such as the location of the emergency exits, the bathroom, etc. Learners should be informed that if at any point they feel frustrated, scared or blocked from completing their work they should approach an appropriate organizer. If they have any concerns about the club and its practices that cannot be addressed by an organizer, they should email [teachtheweb@mozillafoundation.org](mailto:teachtheweb@mozillafoundation.org) directly.

* * *


**III. Host Your First Sessions [Week 4]**

III.A. Select your favorite teaching activities from Mozilla’s collection.  

**Review Mozilla’s teaching activities **

Within our [club curriculum](https://teach.mozilla.org/activities/) you will find activities developed by Mozilla and our communities to help guide you through your regular meetups.

All of our curriculum is available via [teach.mozilla.org/activities](http://teach.mozilla.org/activities). You are free to use any of those pages and tailor the activity to the needs of your club.

If you need any tips, [ask your fellow Club Captains](http://discourse.webmaker.org).

**Adapt the activities to your club**

Here are some ways we recommend adapting our teaching activities to fit your needs:

* Format. Clubs can come in the form of daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly or after school meetups. The time and place for your club meetings can vary, but the meetups should remain consistent so that the learning can be on-going and learners have time to grow and complete multiple activities.

* Time. Time is the biggest variable when running a club activity. Though we’ve suggested time allocations per activity, be aware that depending on many factors this can often be too little or too much time. Age, web experience, number of mentors, internet connection and other factors can all impact how long each activity takes. Plan accordingly if you know you will need more time.

* Age. There is no perfect answer for what age your average attendees should be. The majority of the curriculum was designed with participants aged 14 - 24 in mind, but can be adapted to all levels. We’ve had many older age groups complete--and enjoy--these activities!

* Examples. Consider having an example project, activity or story on hand to help learners visualize what they are doing and better understand the task.

* Be flexible. Use your best judgment when following the activities; your unique situation will likely require you to adapt a little. For example, if learners are asked to complete four tasks but are running out of time, adjust the expectations so they only have to finish two tasks. Find moments throughout the event for the team to evaluate how they might adjust activities to better suit the learners and increase the activities’ success.

III.B. Practice teaching the activities with your team, and then teach it to your learners.

### Practice with your team

**Gather your team and give yourselves the tools you need to be successful.**

* Meet in-person. Discuss the selected teaching activities. Give an overview of the schedule. Identify what parts of the learning will need the most support. Each team member should know what is expected of them so they are poised to give their best effort.

* **Explore the mission.** Your club will be dedicated to [teaching the web](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/Networks). Explain why this matters to you and ask each of your team members to say why they are motivated to be involved.

* Try the activities. Mentors should be aware of the activities being used and what they need to prepare ahead of time. Have the team go through the activities together, and discuss any questions. Know who has which skills and make sure everyone is comfortable with the material. You don’t have to know all the answers -- just be confident in helping your learners find out themselves!

* Give each other feedback on being a facilitative leader. Review what it means to [teach ](https://teach.mozilla.org/teach-like-mozilla/)[like](https://teach.mozilla.org/teach-like-mozilla/)[ Mozilla](https://teach.mozilla.org/teach-like-mozilla/). We encourage learning through making, using participatory methods to teach, using open practices and much more. This is an important step and part of the magic of being a club leader. Support your team members in being facilitative leaders and in giving each other constructive feedback on how to do that better.

* Learners mentor each other. Successful clubs often invite learners to be peer mentors and teachers. Identify when and how you can include this practice in your upcoming session.

### Teach your learners

This is the fun part! Use all your preparation to have a beautiful, successful Mozilla Club session.

## III.C. Share your teaching experience with the Mozilla Club community

### Sharing your experience

Reflection is an important part of learning and connecting. You want to improve as a Club Captain, as well as help your learners have a better experience.

This is why we encourage you to share your experiences after each session. Also invite your learners to publish what they made and what they learned using similar techniques:

* **In-session sharing.** It’s fun to hear and see what others did during the session itself. Gather the group together to share what they did and reflect on the experience. This is an important part of the learning process. Try displaying the work on the walls so others can see (and leave positive comments with post-it notes!), or set up a few demo stations and ask learners to give constructive feedback.

* **Social Media.** Share your experiences using [#teachtheweb](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23teachtheweb&src=typd) and [@Mozteach](https://twitter.com/mozteach) on social media, especially Twitter. You might consider creating a new hashtag just for your club so the learners can keep track of all that happens in one place. Write a few sample tweets and posts that your mentors and learners can share on their networks as well.

* **Website.** You may want a website where learners can showcase what they make, while potential learners can get a feel for what happens. It can also serve as the place you share your blog, integrate your social media channels and post your print materials for others to print. [Wordpress](http://wordpress.com/), [Blogger](http://blogger.com/) and [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) are all easy and free places to start. Don’t forget to share the link on [our discussion forum!](http://discourse.webmaker.org/category/clubs)

* **Feedback, surveys and assessments.** Have regular check-ins with your learners to see how they are progressing. You might learn that you need to revisit certain material, recruit more mentors, adjust the difficulty levels of activities, or change the learning environment. We hear pen and paper is often the most effective method for quick feedback, although online forms or an informal discussion can work, too. It’s most important to ask for feedback immediately after completion of a task or session so that the experience is fresh for your learners.

* **Local Media.** Reach out to local media outlets and tell them what you’re doing. You can tweet or email media outlets, as well as their local reporters who write about similar topics. Remember, you need a good hook. Make it relevant to your local club and environment, and tell them why what you’re doing matters in your community.

* Join our discussion forum. Ask your team and learners to sign up on our discussion forum, [Discourse](http://discourse.webmaker.org/category/clubs). Introduce yourselves and publish what you’re learning and making.

### Appendix. More Resources

Mozilla Clubs is a relatively new program. It’s open source, so it’s changing and improving all the time. Check in regularly with your Regional Coordinator and the teach.mozilla.org website for more resources.
